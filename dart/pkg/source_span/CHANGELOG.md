# 1.0.0

This package was extracted from the
[`source_maps`](http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/source_maps) package, but the
API has many differences. Among them:

* `Span` has been renamed to `SourceSpan` and `Location` has been renamed to
  `SourceLocation` to clarify their purpose and maintain consistency with the
  package name. Likewise, `SpanException` is now `SourceSpanException` and
  `SpanFormatException` is not `SourceSpanFormatException`.

* `FixedSpan` and `FixedLocation` have been rolled into the `Span` and
  `Location` classes, respectively.

* `SourceFile` is more aggressive about validating its arguments. Out-of-bounds
  lines, columns, and offsets will now throw errors rather than be silently
  clamped.

* `SourceSpan.sourceUrl`, `SourceLocation.sourceUrl`, and `SourceFile.url` now
  return `Uri` objects rather than `String`s. The constructors allow either
  `String`s or `Uri`s.

* `Span.getLocationMessage` and `SourceFile.getLocationMessage` are now
  `SourceSpan.message` and `SourceFile.message`, respectively. Rather than
  taking both a `useColor` and a `color` parameter, they now take a single
  `color` parameter that controls both whether and which color is used.

* `Span.isIdentifier` has been removed. This property doesn't make sense outside
  of a source map context.

* `SourceFileSegment` has been removed. This class wasn't widely used and was
  inconsistent in its choice of which parameters were considered relative and
  which absolute.
