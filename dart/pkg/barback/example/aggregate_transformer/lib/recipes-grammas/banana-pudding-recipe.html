<ul>
<li>1/4 cup water</li>
<li>2 Tblsp flour</li>
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
<li>6 lg eggs</li>
<li>1 can evaporated milk</li>
<li>1 Tblsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>16 oz sour cream</li>
<li>3 large bananas, sliced</li>
<li>1 (16 oz) package of vanilla wafers</li>
</ul>
<p>
Add water to saucepan. Whisk in flour until smooth. Add sugar
and mix well. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each one.
Slowly stir in milk, mixing well.</p>
<p>
Place pan on low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture
is thickened to the consistency of a thick gravy, approximately
20 minutes. The mixture will start to steam and produce bubbles,
but you don't want a full boil.</p>
<p>
Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Cool thoroughly. Fold in
sour cream and mix well.</p>
<p>
Layer wafers, bananas, and pudding in a glass serving bowl, such
as a trifle bowl. Thoroughly chill. Serve with whipped cream.</p>
