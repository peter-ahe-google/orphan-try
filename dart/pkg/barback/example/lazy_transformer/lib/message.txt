Dear Mom,

Hi! How are you? Sorry that I haven't written recently,
but I hope all is well!

Life is great at University. I'm sure that I can bring
up my D- in French.

Also, the Dean's office says they won't press charges.
It was a big todo about nothing - just your typical college
prank and the badger (UFE's mascot) was eating pretty
well on my lunch card. And some spackle will fix the
damage to my dorm room walls right up...

By the way, can I have a loan? $300 would be great.

Thanks so much and I love you!

Your loving son,

     Rodger
