Dart Observatory Developer Guide
---

Assumptions:
You are running pub from the latest dev channel release of Dart Editor.

During development you do not need to run dart2js or rebuild the VM (unless
you are also making changes to the backend). While you're working on your
feature follow the steps:

1. Open runtime/bin/vmservice/observatory in the Dart Editor
2. Run pub upgrade
3. Run dart --observe script.dart
4. Run index.html in Dartium

At this point you should see the initial Observatory UI and that
it is communicating with the VM you launched in step 3.

Continue to develop and iterate until you're ready to upload your change
for review. Upload your change and get an LGTM.

5. Run pub build
6. Run ./deploy.sh

Note: If you run pub from within the editor you need to make sure that it runs
in release mode (--mode=release), i.e., output is minified and does not include
any .dart source files.

At this point you should rebuild your VM and:

7. Launch dart --observe script.dart

In a non-Dart enabled browser navigate to localhost:8181 and ensure
that your feature works after being compiled to JavaScript.

8. Ensure the vm, standalone, and observatory unit tests still pass:
python tools/test.py --mode=debug --arch=ia32 --compiler=none --runtime=vm vm/cc standalone/vmservice vmservice

9. Commit your change
